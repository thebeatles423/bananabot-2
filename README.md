# Bananabot
A Discord bot with various utilities and other features that I may or may not use in the future

## Usage
You can self host the bot for your own purposes if you'd like:
* Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kbidlack/bananabot.git
```
* Navigate to the newly created directory:
```
cd bananabot
```
* Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```
* Create a file called `.env` and put your bot token in it like this:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN="<your_token_here>"
```
* Run the bot!
```
python src/main.py
```
